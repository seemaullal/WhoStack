**WhoStack**
=============
Do you use Slack and find yourself having trouble keeping track of who's who in your channels? Use WhoStack to learn new names and faces! 

Usage
-------
You can download our code from this repo but will not be able to run it unless you provide your own Slack API configuration information. Our site is currently live at 
http://whostack.herokuapp.com. Please visit it and use WhoStack. 

Technologies Used
-----------
WhoStack was made using Express.js and Node.js on the backend and HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the frontend. We use the Slack API to get user information about their groups and the users in those groups.

We plan to add more features to WhoStack soon and also hopefully add integrations with more services beyond Slack. Check back soon for more information and updates!

WhoStack was created by Sarah Muenzinger and Seema Ullal in 2015.
